I’ve completed Task 1 out of 3 in my internship with Future Intern.

For this task, I created a landing page called “WhisperTales” using HTML and CSS. This helped me learn how to structure and style a simple yet effective webpage.
Here’s what I learned:
->Organizing HTML elements clearly.
->Styling with CSS for clean and user-friendly design.
->Building a landing page from scratch.
